    "GitHub Copilot: This is a Python script that uses the Pygame library to create a digital twin of a pendulum system. The pendulum's state is updated based on the model dynamics and the actions performed. The script also includes functionality for recording and loading data, and for visualizing the pendulum's state.\n",

    "Here's a brief overview of the main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `DigitalTwin`: This is the main class that represents the digital twin of the pendulum system. It includes methods for initializing the Pygame window, connecting to a device via serial communication, reading and processing data from the device, recording and loading data, performing actions, updating the state of the system, and rendering the state of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `initialize_pygame_window`: This method initializes the Pygame window.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `connect_device`: This method establishes a serial connection for sensor data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `read_data`: This method reads data from the device.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `process_data`: This method processes the sensor data. It's currently a placeholder and needs to be implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `start_recording` and `stop_recording`: These methods start and stop the recording of data, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `load_recording` and `recorded_step`: These methods load a recording and return a recorded step, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `perform_action`: This method performs an action by sending a command to the device.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `update_motor_accelerations`: This method updates the expected acceleration response of the motor.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `get_theta_double_dot`: This method models the angular acceleration as a function of theta, theta_dot and the current motor acceleration. It's currently a placeholder and needs to be implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `step`: This method updates the state of the system based on the action and model dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `render`: This method renders the state of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `check_prediction_lists`: This method checks if the prediction lists are empty and if so, it fills them with zeros.\n",
